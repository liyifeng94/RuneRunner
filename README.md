**“Slice through endless enemies as you go on your final journey.”**



</p>A Twitch-based action game designed for players who are looking for a distraction while waiting for something else.</p>


> Rune Walker is a reflex-based action game that requires you to think on your feet as you go on your long walk. While on your journey, clusters of enemies will periodically appear and run at you. You must either dodge, jump or block the enemy attacks before you can counterattack. If you press the wrong button, or press the button too late, you will die and have to restart! If you’re feeling overwhelmed, you can use Rune Blast to destroy all enemies onscreen, or you can hold onto it to increase your score multiplier. The longer you hold on to your runic power, the more your score multiplies. Naturally, your score also increases the longer you manage to remain within the game before dying. Surviving for long periods of time also introduces you to new environments. This is a twitch-based game in that the primary measure of skill is in the player’s quick reflexes -- while each enemy has an obvious response, the player must press the correct answer before the enemy finishes their attack or else they’ll lose. The further the player goes, the more enemies will spawn, steadily increasing the difficulty for the player in predicting the enemy attacks.
